AS WE HAVE INCLUDED THE .env FILE INSIDE THE server FOLDER, IN gitignore OF THE ROOT FOLDER OF OUR APPLICATION, THE .env FILE IS IGNORED BY GIT.

SO, MAKE SURE TO CREATE YOUR OWN .env FILE INSIDE THE server FOLDER SO THAT OUR APPLICATION CAN USE THE MONGO_URI SECRET (AND OTHER SECRETS IF THEY LATER GET ADDED INTO .env).

[NOTE: ALSO ADD ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE (IF ANY) FOUND IN THE CODE]
